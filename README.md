- Thanks for stopping by! Take a moment to get to know me a little better!

🎓 I'm 19 years old and currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. In 2024, I’m in my second year, specifically the 5th semester.

☁ My passion in technology is the DevOps field. I'm actively seeking knowledge and developing technical skills to work with different cloud providers, their services, and the tools that enable resource provisioning.

💻 I also work with web development tools, especially focusing on Back-end development with PHP (Laravel) and its related technologies (libraries and frameworks).

🔍 My biggest motivation for specializing in technology is my belief that, in the near future, all fields of knowledge will rely on it. My goal is to be prepared both personally and professionally to meet the market's innovative demands.

✅ I’m communicative and love socializing, which I see as an important virtue in the workplace. In the tech field, agile development methodologies (SCRUM) require this ability.
